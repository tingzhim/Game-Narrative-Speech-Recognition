# MGNR: Multimodal Game Narration Recognition by Integrating Game Videos and Narration Speech

# Content

  # Introduction
    This is the respository of Towards Practical Lipreading with Distilled and Efficient Models and Lipreading using Temporal Convolutional Networks. In this repository, we provide training code, pre-trained models, network settings for end-to-end visual speech recognition (lipreading). We trained our model on LRW. 
  # Framework
  The network architecture is based on 3D convolution, ResNet-18 plus MS-TCN.
